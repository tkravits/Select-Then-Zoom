# Select-Then-Zoom
This ArcPy code is designed to select a field within a layer and zoom to it in ArcGIS Desktop. It was developed using ArcMap 10.5. This code also assumes the individual knows how to create a toolbox in ArcGIS. If help is needed to create a toolbox see: https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/managing-tools-and-toolboxes/creating-a-custom-toolbox.htm 

The user will set up ahead of time what field is to be selected. Once the toolbox is opened, it will ask for the user input for the field.
